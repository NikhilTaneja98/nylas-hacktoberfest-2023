# üóìÔ∏è Delete Calendar Event 

Delete calendar events using the Nylas Python SDK and Poetry.

## üìú Introduction

The `delete_calendar` project is a Python script that leverages the Nylas Python SDK to read and delete calendar events from a Nylas calendar. It's designed to provide a straightforward way to fetch, display, and delete calendar events using events ids.

## ‚ú® Features

- Read and delete calendar events using events ids.
- Handle Nylas API errors and edge cases.
- Integrates with Poetry for dependency management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Before using this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Make
- Nylas API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- A Nylas Event ID
- Writable Calendar Permissions (Ensure that you are attempting to delete events from a calendar for which you have the necessary write permissions. If you don't have write permissions, you won't be able to delete events.)

## üîß Using Make

You can use the `make` command for common development tasks. Here are some useful targets:

- `make venv`: Create a virtual environment.
- `make install`: Generate a `.env` file and install required dependencies.
- `make run`: Run the app using Poetry.
- `make clean`: Remove build, test, coverage, and Python artifacts.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Fork/Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delete_calendar.git
    cd delete_calendar
    ```

1. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    make venv
    ```

1. Install project dependencies using Poetry:

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

1. Configure your Nylas API credentials in the `.env` file by setting your `'CLIENT_ID'`, `'CLIENT_SECRET'`, and `'ACCESS_TOKEN'`  with your actual credentials.

## üèÅ Getting Started

After completing the installation steps, you're ready to get started:

1. Run the script to delete calendar events:

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

Read the on-screen information and copy a calendar event ID to delete it using its ID.
